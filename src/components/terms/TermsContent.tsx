                      virtual classrooms. We offer unique features such as:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      2D Classrooms: Enjoy interactive, virtual environments
                      tailored for education. Meet-to-Earn: Earn rewards for

                      protection.

                    <h2>Earning Points and Rewards</h2>
                    <ul className="__pd_roman_list_lower">
                      <li>
                        <h4>Meet-to-Earn:</h4>
                        <p>
                          Students on Pody Network are rewarded based on the
                          time they spend in virtual classrooms. Points are
                          calculated in real-time using a hash rate per second
                          system. The longer you participate in a session, the
                          more points you accumulate. However, final point
                          calculations are made when you leave the classroom or
                          the session ends.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Teacher Rewards:</h4>
                        <p>
                          Teachers (hosts) receive an additional 10% of the
                          total points earned by all participants in their
                          classrooms. This bonus is calculated at the end of the
                          session or when students leave. These points reflect
                          engagement and participation, enhancing the rewards
                          system for both students and hosts.
                        </p>

                      <li>
                        <h4>Earning Power Boost:</h4>
                        <p>
                          By minting more NFTs directly from the Pody dashboard,
                          users can boost their point-earning capabilities.
                        </p>

                  <li>
                    <h2>Loyalty Points and Their Use</h2>
                    <p>
                      All points earned on Pody Network should be viewed as
                      loyalty points. While these points may provide various
                      in-platform benefits or be redeemed in certain cases, they
                      do not guarantee monetary value. Points are tracked in
                      real-time, but due to technology limitations such as
                      network delays, the final points calculated may differ
                      slightly from those displayed during the meeting.

                    <p>
                      Hosts have access to advanced management features,
                      allowing them to:

                    <h2>NFT Passport and Decentralization</h2>
                    <p>
                      Pody Network utilizes an NFT Passport, a decentralized
                      digital identity that secures your participation on the
                      platform. Each NFT represents your unique profile on the
                      blockchain, making the classroom environment decentralized
                      and tamper-proof. Your participation, rewards, and
                      engagement are all verifiable and secure.

                    <h2>Data Privacy and Security</h2>
                    <p>
                      Pody Network respects your privacy. The platform does not
                      store or track any personal data outside of necessary
                      information like your wallet address and username. All
                      interactions within the classroom are private, and no
                      meeting content is recorded. Any information collected is
                      used solely for maintaining the platform&apos;s functionality
                      and performance.

                    <p>
                      You are bound by LiveKit&apos;s Privacy Policy, as it governs
                      certain aspects of the Pody Network experience.

                    <p>
                      While Pody Network strives to offer the best real-time
                      experience, there may be occasional technical limitations,
                      such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Network Delays: Points may be displayed inaccurately
                        during meetings due to real-time calculation
                        limitations.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Technology Glitches: Points may differ slightly when
                        recalculated after the meeting ends. In all cases, the
                        final points awarded at the end of the session will be
                        the accurate reflection of your participation.
