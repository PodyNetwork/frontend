                      We only collect minimal personal data to ensure the proper

                    <p>
                      IP Information: Collected to help us ensure security,

                    <p>
                      We respect your privacy during meetings. Pody Network does
                      not record or store any meeting content. Users can engage
                      in meetings with the assurance that their discussions
                      remain private and are not monitored by us.

                    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>
                      Pody Network integrates certain third-party services to
                      provide a seamless meeting experience. Specifically, our
                      app is governed by the LiveKit Privacy Policy. Users of
                      Pody Network are also bound by LiveKitâ€™s privacy terms,
                      which can be reviewed on their official website.
